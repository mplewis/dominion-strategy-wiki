'''[[Haunted Castle]]''' is a [[Victory]]-[[Castle]] card from {{Set|Empires}}, worth {{VP|2}} and positioned fourth in the {{Card|Castles}} [[split pile]]. When you [[gain]] it during your turn, you receive a free {{Card|Gold}} and each other player with 5 or more cards in hand puts 2 cards from their hand onto their deck. Though not technically an [[Attack]] card, it functions as a [[handsize attack]] similar to {{Card|Ghost Ship}}.

Haunted Castle went through several iterations during development, including versions that shuffled cards from discard into deck and a one-time cursing variant. Donald X. added the "on your turn" restriction to prevent weird interactions while still allowing synergy with {{Card|Small Castle}}, and chose simpler wording than {{Card|Ghost Ship}} to avoid the complexity of variable handsize effects.
