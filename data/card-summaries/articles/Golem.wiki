'''[[Golem]]''' is an [[Action]] card from {{Set|Alchemy}} costing {{Cost|4|P}}. It [[dig]]s through your deck to reveal 2 [[Action]] cards (other than Golems) and forces you to play them in either order. This makes it an unconventional [[village (card category)|village]] and draw substitute, but with significant drawbacks due to limited control over what gets played.

Golem's {{Cost||||P}} cost and inability to play other Golems create major constraints: it's slow to gain, difficult to scale up, and risks playing two [[terminal]]s or suboptimal card combinations. While it offers useful [[sifting]] in junk-heavy decks, it's typically used as pseudo-draw in the late midgame alongside more reliable villages, rather than as a primary engine component.
