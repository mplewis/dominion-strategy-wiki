'''[[Buried Treasure]]''' is a [[Treasure]]-[[Duration]] card from {{Set|Plunder}}. It automatically plays itself when gained and provides +1 Buy and {{Costplus|3}} at the start of your next turn. This makes it a delayed [[payload]] card that gives significant economy and purchasing power the turn after acquisition. As Donald X. Vaccarino described it, Buried Treasure is "the payload version of {{Card|Den of Sin}}," providing economic benefit rather than draw.

Originally costing {{Cost|3}} with no +Buy, Buried Treasure was increased to {{Cost|5}} and given +Buy after online testing revealed it was "nuts" at the lower cost, demonstrating how powerful delayed economy can be.
