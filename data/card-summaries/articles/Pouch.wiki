'''[[Pouch]]''' is a [[Treasure]]-[[Heirloom]] card from {{Set|Nocturne}} that replaces one of your starting {{Card|Copper|Coppers}} when {{Card|Tracker}} is in the [[Kingdom]]. It provides {{Cost|1}} and '''+1 Buy''', making it essentially a {{Card|Copper}} with an additional purchase. This makes it particularly valuable early in the game for gaining multiple cheap cards or later for enabling multi-{{Card|Province}} turns.

Pouch originally provided {{Cost|0}} and only +1 Buy, but Donald X. changed it to produce {{Cost|1}} after Matt's playtest group found the slower games unenjoyable. The card pairs thematically well with {{Card|Tracker}}'s {{Card|Royal Seal}} ability, as the extra Buy helps utilize the topdeck effect more effectively.
