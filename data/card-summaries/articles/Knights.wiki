'''[[Knights]]''' are an [[Action]]-[[Attack]] [[Supply]] pile from {{Set|Dark Ages}} containing 10 differently-named unique cards with the [[Knight]] type. When selected as a [[Kingdom]] card, they are shuffled into a single face-down pile with only the top card visible and available for purchase. Each Knight costs {{Cost|5}} (except {{Card|Sir Martin}} at {{Cost|4}}) and shares the same [[trashing attack]] that can destroy other Knights.

The Knights pile creates unique strategic dynamics as players compete for specific Knights with useful secondary abilities like {{Card|Dame Anna}}'s trashing or {{Card|Dame Josephine}}'s {{VP|2}}. The shared attack ability means Knights can destroy each other, creating a self-limiting mechanic where playing Knights against Knight-heavy opponents can backfire, leading to interesting tactical decisions about timing and targeting.
