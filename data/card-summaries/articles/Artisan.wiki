'''[[Artisan]]''' is an [[Action]] card from the [[second edition]] of the {{Set|Dominion|Base set}}. It is a powerful but expensive [[gainer]] costing {{Cost|6}} that allows you to gain a card costing up to {{Cost|5}} to your hand, then put a card from your hand onto your deck. This makes it excellent for quickly adding strong cards to your deck and potentially playing them immediately.

Artisan shines in Kingdoms with strong [[Village (card category)|villages]] and [[draw]] that can mitigate the topdecking drawback and enable gain-and-play strategies. Even without perfect support, it remains valuable for rapidly acquiring powerful {{Cost|5}} cards and can be useful for gaining [[Victory]] cards like {{Card|Duchy|Duchies}} in the endgame when other buying options are limited.
