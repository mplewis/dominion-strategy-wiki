'''[[Procession]]''' is an [[Action]] card from {{Set|Dark Ages}} costing {{Cost|4}}. It combines {{Card|Throne Room}} and {{Card|Upgrade}} effects by playing a non-[[Duration]] Action twice, then trashing it to gain an Action costing exactly {{Cost|1}} more. This creates a powerful but double-edged effect that improves your deck while consuming the cards you most want to double.

Procession excels when the Kingdom offers powerful cards to throne (like {{Card|Horse|Horses}} or {{Card|Experiment}}), ways to gain those cards in bulk, and desirable Actions at the right price points. It enables explosive [[gain-and-play]] chains and rapid [[three-pile ending|pileouts]], but requires careful setup to avoid trashing valuable Actions without adequate replacements.
