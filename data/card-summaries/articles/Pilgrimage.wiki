'''[[Pilgrimage]]''' is an [[Event]] from {{Set|Adventures}}. It costs {{Cost|4}} and can only be bought once per turn, flipping your {{AdvToken|Journey}} token (which starts face up). If the token ends face up after flipping, you choose up to three differently named cards you have in play and gain a copy of each. This effectively costs {{Cost|8}} over two turns but can gain very expensive cards like {{Card|King's Court}} or {{Card|Familiar}} that you already have in play, making it potentially extremely profitable for engines that want multiples of their key components.

Originally it didn't have the "once per turn" restriction, but Donald X. Vaccarino found it "too attractive to pay {{Cost|8}} and 2 Buys for" without that limitation.
