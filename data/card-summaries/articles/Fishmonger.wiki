'''[[Fishmonger]]''' is an [[Action]]-[[Shadow]] card from {{Set|Rising Sun}}. It provides '''+1 Buy''' and {{Costplus|1}}, but as a [[Shadow]] card, you can play it directly from your deck as if it were in your hand. This makes it a reliable source of [[+Buy]] that doesn't require drawing to access, and particularly useful for guaranteeing {{Cost|5}} in opening turns.

Fishmonger developed from Donald X.'s experiments with Shadow cards beyond {{Card|Ninja}}, testing both "+2 Cards" and "+1 Buy {{Costplus|2}}" versions. He chose the smaller version because it creates interesting gameplay in opening turns where it can guarantee specific price points, making it strategically valuable despite its modest effects.
