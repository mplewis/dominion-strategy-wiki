'''[[Aqueduct]]''' is a [[Landmark]] from {{Set|Empires}}. It functions like a [[Gathering]] card, accumulating {{VP}} tokens as players gain [[Treasure]]s (moving {{VP|1}} from the Treasure's pile to Aqueduct), then giving all accumulated tokens to the first player who gains a [[Victory]] card. The setup places {{VP|8}} on the {{Card|Silver}} and {{Card|Gold}} piles to seed the system.

Aqueduct creates interesting timing decisions around when to green, as the first player to gain a Victory card claims all accumulated points. This can incentivize earlier greening or enable "megaturn" strategies where a player gains many Treasures (such as with {{Card|Masterpiece}}) before claiming the tokens with a single {{Card|Estate}} purchase.
