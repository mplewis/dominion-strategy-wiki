'''[[Dame Natalie]]''' is one of the ten {{Card|Knights}} from {{Set|Dark Ages}}. Like other [[Knight]]s, she is an [[Action]]-[[Attack]]-[[Knight]] that performs a [[trashing attack]], but she also functions as a [[gainer]] that allows you to gain a card costing up to {{Cost|3}}. This dual functionality makes her particularly valuable when there are useful {{Cost|3}} cards in the Supply.

Dame Natalie can sometimes be especially worth prioritizing if the Kingdom contains strong {{Cost|3}} cards that you want multiple copies of, such as [[village (card category)|villages]] or other key engine pieces. Her gaining ability provides immediate deck improvement alongside the standard Knight attack, making her one of the more versatile Knights in the pile.
