'''[[Fellowship of Scribes]]''' is an [[Ally]] from {{Set|Allies}}. After playing an [[Action]] card, if you have 4 or fewer cards in hand, you may spend a [[Favor]] to draw a card. This provides conditional card draw that helps maintain hand size when playing cards that don't naturally replace themselves or when your hand is depleted.

Fellowship of Scribes represents Donald X.'s tweaked version of {{Card|Horse|Horses}} adapted for the [[Allies]] token system. It offers reliable but limited card draw that scales with your [[Favor]] accumulation, particularly valuable in engines that struggle with hand size management or when you need to convert Favors into immediate deck cycling benefits.
