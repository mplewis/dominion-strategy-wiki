'''[[Trickster]]''' is an [[Action]]-[[Attack]] card from {{Set|Plunder}}. It gives each other player a {{Card|Curse}}, making it a straightforward [[curser]]. Additionally, once per turn when you discard a [[Treasure]] from play, you may set it aside and put it back in your hand at the end of your turn. This allows you to save valuable Treasures like {{Card|Gold}} or special Treasures from Plunder to use again next turn, providing both offensive cursing and economic advantage.

The card's wording was tweaked during development, but Donald X. Vaccarino noted that its core functionality remained the same throughout the design process.
