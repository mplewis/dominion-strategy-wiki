'''[[Misery]]''' is a [[Hex]] from {{Set|Nocturne}}. It is the only [[Attack]]-style effect that exclusively damages your score without affecting your deck or hand. When you first receive it, you take the {{State|Miserable}} state ({{VP|-2}}), and if you receive it again, you flip to {{State|Twice Miserable}} ({{VP|-4}} total). Additional instances have no further effect.

Misery is unique among Hexes in that it provides purely scoring punishment rather than tactical disruption. This makes it a straightforward but potentially devastating penalty that accumulates over time, particularly dangerous in games where {{Card|Familiar}} or other [[Hex]] sources are frequently activated, as the scoring penalty can significantly impact final results.
