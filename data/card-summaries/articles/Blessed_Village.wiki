'''[[Blessed Village]]''' is an [[Action]]-[[Fate]] card from {{Set|Nocturne}}. It functions as a standard {{Cost|4}} [[Village (card category)|village]] providing '''+1 Card''' and '''+2 Actions''', but also grants a [[Boon]] when gained, which you can receive immediately or save for the start of your next turn. This timing flexibility adds strategic depth to an otherwise vanilla village.

Blessed Village offers value beyond typical engine building through its [[when-gain|on-gain]] Boon effect. Early acquisition can provide useful acceleration through Boons like {{Boon|The Flame's Gift}} for trashing or {{Boon|The Forest's Gift}} for coin, while the option to delay Boons enables tactical timing around effects that are more valuable on future turns.
