'''[[Humble Castle]]''' is a [[Treasure]]-[[Victory]]-[[Castle]] card from {{Set|Empires}}, positioned first in the {{Card|Castles}} [[split pile]]. It provides {{Cost|1}} as a Treasure and is worth {{VP|1}} per Castle you have (including itself). This scaling victory point mechanism rewards players who commit to acquiring multiple Castles throughout the game.

Humble Castle's dual nature as both Treasure and Victory card makes it unique among basic payload options. While initially worth only {{VP|1}}, it can become significantly more valuable with additional Castle acquisitions, creating interesting timing decisions around when to prioritize Castle accumulation versus other strategic pursuits in the {{Card|Castles}} pile progression.
