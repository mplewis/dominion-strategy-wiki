'''[[Nomad Camp]]''' is an [[Action]] card from the first edition of {{Set|Hinterlands}}. It has the same on-play effect as {{Card|Woodcutter}} (+1 Buy and {{Costplus|2}}), but when gained, it goes to the top of your deck instead of your discard pile. While this can occasionally help with economy timing on {{Split|4|3}} openings or guarantee payload for Province purchases, it generally makes an already weak [[terminal silver]] even weaker by putting a [[stop card]] on top of your deck. It was removed from Hinterlands Second Edition and replaced with {{Card|Nomads}}.

Donald X. Vaccarino explained that Nomad Camp was "basically a {{Card|Woodcutter}} with a penalty" and cost {{Cost|4}} instead of {{Cost|3}} because he didn't want to make "strictly better cards" than Woodcutter, even though the topdeck effect often makes it worse than its {{Cost|3}} predecessor.
