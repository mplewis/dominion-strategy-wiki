'''[[Coastal Haven]]''' is an [[Ally]] from {{Set|Allies}}. It allows you to spend [[Favor]] tokens during [[Clean-up]] to keep cards in your hand for the next turn, while still drawing your normal hand of 5 cards. This effectively increases your hand size for the following turn by letting you retain useful cards that would otherwise be discarded.

Coastal Haven provides flexibility in hand management, allowing players to save key cards across turns when they have accumulated [[Favor]]s from other [[Allies]] cards. The wording underwent multiple revisions during development while maintaining the same core functionality of preserving cards between turns.
