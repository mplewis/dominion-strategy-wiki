'''[[Silos]]''' is a [[Project]] from {{Set|Renaissance}}. For {{Cost|4}}, it gives you the ability to discard any number of {{Card|Copper|Coppers}} at the start of your turn (revealed to prove they're Coppers) and draw that many cards. This effectively allows you to [[sifter|sift]] past Coppers in your starting hand, providing useful deck [[cycling]] and reliability improvements. Silos works particularly well in kingdoms with slow [[thinning]] or as a supplement to Copper trashing, and synergizes with cards that benefit from having Coppers in your discard pile.

Donald X. Vaccarino noted that Silos remained "unchanged" throughout playtesting, and described it as letting you "{{Card|Cellar}} away {{Card|Copper|Coppers}} at the start of your turn."
