'''[[Clashes]]''' is a [[split pile]] from {{Set|Allies}} containing 4 copies each of {{Card|Battle Plan}}, {{Card|Archer}}, {{Card|Warlord}}, and {{Card|Territory}} in that order. Only the top card can be gained at any time, but {{Card|Battle Plan}} allows you to "rotate" the pile by moving all copies of the current top card to the bottom. The pile represents a military invasion progression from planning through conquest.

The Clashes pile was designed with a top-down thematic approach, with Donald X. considering various military-themed names like Campaign, General, and Army before settling on the final four. The cards tell a story of military progression while providing strategic rotation mechanics that allow players to access different cards throughout the game.
