'''[[Improve]]''' is an [[Action]] card from {{Set|Renaissance}} costing {{Cost|3}}. It's a [[terminal silver]] that provides {{Costplus|2}}, and at the start of [[Clean-up]], you may [[trash]] an Action card you would discard from play to gain a card costing exactly {{Cost|1}} more. This combines immediate payload with deck improvement.

Improve was requested by Ben and Steveie to create card progression reminiscent of {{Card|Procession}}. Originally costing {{Cost|4}} and triggering when discarding from play, it shifted to Clean-up timing to avoid complex interactions with other discard effects. The ability to trash and upgrade the Improve itself creates interesting strategic decisions throughout the game.
