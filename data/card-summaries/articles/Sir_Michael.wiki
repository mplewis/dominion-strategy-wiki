'''[[Sir Michael]]''' is one of the ten {{Card|Knights}} from {{Set|Dark Ages}}. Like other [[Knight]]s, he performs the standard [[trashing attack]], but uniquely also functions as a [[discard attack]] that forces each other player to discard down to 3 cards in hand before the trashing occurs. This dual attack makes him particularly disruptive.

Sir Michael's discard attack is most effective in the midgame when players have moved beyond having mostly junk to discard but haven't yet achieved reliable [[deck control]]. The combination of hand size reduction followed by deck trashing creates a powerful one-two punch that can severely disrupt opponents' turns and long-term strategies.
